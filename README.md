# DataListDev
 using MvcMovie tutorial as a building block, trying to create a data list with mobile db connection

This was my first viewing of Azure and MVC over 3 days. I worked through the Azure tutorials, creating a MvcMovie database web app,
creating a toDoList auto updating Windows web and phone app. Managed to do about half the time trying to get my computer to run things 
without errors. Mobile phone app tutorial would not work at all, some how causing my previous tutorial to error in such a way that
I could create nothing without getting an error about the app not being valid, even after recreating 2 different tutorials from scratch,
coming up with that error over and over again. Deciding to just work on understanding whats suppose to be going on.

I understand what needs to be done, I believe, You have the MVC model of development in which you are going to have the MODELS set with your table
classes. Possibly creating a dupilcate mobile set of tables to link the mobile database with. 
Inside the CONTROLLER will also have the Setter and getter functions for all inputs, as the Model is where the constructors and building blocks for
the CONTROLLER to
hang out and where VIEW reads from. VIEW holds all the style side of things, the positions of where everything goes, the style of the readin
user inputs, setting of the display table.

I couldnt for the life of me find a direct answer on where to create the requested CLIENT OBJECT where the call to MobileServiceClient 
goes. I have a feeling iv been over thinking it, but without a direct view or someones assistance, it has been an excersise in futility.

CREATE CLASSES FOR BOTH TABLES, is pretty straight forward. the layout for them is easy after seeing how to do sql tables in the mvcMovie 
tutorial. However, without actually knowing how the call to pass data between the mobileclient and the created tables on my side meant I
was just circling the internet for answers instead of creating the next step which to me would have been to have setters and getters to
pull through the data required from the mobile client database, based on search requirements. There was a page I found with all the code for
the different searches you'd do. then set them to my created tables to be read by the VIEW section.

I worked on for a bit just messing around with the layout and css of the page I made to be the index and main page of the app.
But after changing the bootstrap css to a closer theme to what your pictures where, and going over some of the html codes that mvcMovies files 
had to create their layouts and remind me about the construction of a html website, I just sat back and wonderered what went wrong.

I really enjoyed looking at Azure, MVC is a fantastic streamlined way of creation and I can see it being very effective when you know 
where to go to put the code you are thinking of in. I really think universities should really be using them as a kick off point before they
go into the ins and outs of deeper coding with reference to virtual environment coding for simulation and video games. Because from what I have
seen in these past 3 days is that with the understanding of Azure, .NET MVC and a bit of SQL, you can accomplish a lot. Everything else
is icing on the cake but without some of this well structured API understanding of Azure which is obviously great for development, then
it feels very disapointing to come so far and feel absolutly helpless to a new program.

Has really been an eye opener and really pushing me to want to go beyond what I am given as a student. I really want to understand and
do more small scale development so I can reach the point where I know the ins and outs of Azure and MVC and this sort of dev test 
will be and should be a cake walk. But until then, I take this as a great learning experience and a very much needed one.
I do appologise for my wasting of your time and hope in the future that I may be able to be a bit more confident in things and a lot more
knowledgeable in coding with a purpose. I shall be working on this myself to figure out Azure further so I may use this to make some of
my assigments more professional in the units to come.

Kind regards,
Christoph
